obsolete Gene_Ontology	biological_process
molecular_function	molecular_function
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.	subset: goslim_candida

comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply the enzyme name. The name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.1.116, GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.1.116) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3, GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.1.116 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.	synonym: "ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase activity" EXACT []

def: "Combining with a chemokine, and transmitting the signal from one side of the membrane to the other to initiate a change in cell activity. Chemokines are a family of small chemotactic cytokines; their name is derived from their ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells. All chemokines possess a number of conserved cysteine residues involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation. Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria." [GOC:BHF, GOC:rl, GOC:signaling, IUPHAR_GPCR:1280, PMID:12183377, PMID:8662823, Wikipedia:Chemokine]	is_a: GO:0001637 !

comment: Note that 'nucleolar' in the name acronym 'snoRNA' is part of the RNA family designation 'small nucleolar', and does not reflect the location of the complex. Both box C/D type and box H/ACA RNAs are found in Archaea (where they are referred to as sRNAs) as well as in Eukaryota. In eukaryotes, box H/ACA RNAs are found in both nucleolar-localized snoRNP complexes and in Cajal body-localized scaRNP complexes.	subset: goslim_pir

def: "The function of a family of small chemotactic cytokines; their name is derived from their ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells. All chemokines possess a number of conserved cysteine residues involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation. Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria." [GOC:BHF, GOC:rl, PMID:12183377, Wikipedia:Chemokine]	subset: goslim_chembl

comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to two different functions, a glutamine amidotransferase that functions as an aminodeoxychorismate synthase [itself composed of two enzymatic activities, a glutaminase and a chorismate aminase (this latter is sometimes referred to as the aminodeoxychorismate synthase)] and a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate aromatase (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase). Note that the name 'para-amino benzoate synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional lyase activity was discovered.	synonym: "para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) synthase" EXACT []

comment: This term was made obsolete because it refers to two different functions, a glutamine amidotransferase that functions as an aminodeoxychorismate synthase [itself composed of two enzymatic activities, a glutaminase and a chorismate aminase (this latter is sometimes referred to as the aminodeoxychorismate synthase)] and a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate aromatase (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase). Note that the name 'para-amino benzoate synthase' was initially given to the 'aminodeoxychorismate synthase' activity before the additional lyase activity was discovered.	synonym: "p-aminobenzoate synthetase" EXACT []

chemokine binding	molecular_function
def: "Binding to a chemokine. Chemokines are a family of small chemotactic cytokines; their name is derived from their ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells. All chemokines possess a number of conserved cysteine residues involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation. Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria." [GOC:ai, GOC:BHF, GOC:rl, PMID:12183377, Wikipedia:Chemokine]	is_a: GO:0019955 ! cytokine binding

pre-B cell receptor complex	cellular_component
comment: Despite its name, the pre-BCR is not a receptor complex, as it appears to provide a low level of signal not dependent on a ligand, but rather simply on correct assembly of the complex as a measure for correct Ig heavy chain recombination and folding. A significant proportion of pre-BCR complexes fail to reach the cell surface, and in some cases may provide their signaling function from the trans-Golgi network or lysosome.	synonym: "pre-BCR" EXACT []

comment: Take care to annotate to the reaction, not simply by enzyme name. Note that the name "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" (listed as a synonym here) has variously been used to refer to two distinctly different enzymes. Both enzymes act on ureidoglycolate and produce glyoxylate, but the mechanism and reaction products are different. The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" listed in the Enzyme commission (EC) is a ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase, releasing ammonia, (EC:3.5.3.19 ; GO:0004848). The "ureidoglycolate hydrolase" characterized in PMID:3915539 (published prior to the EC designation of EC:3.5.3.19) is a ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea (EC:4.3.2.3 ; GO:0050385). The inappropriate labelling of ureidoglycolate lyase as EC:3.5.3.19 has caused much confusion in the literature (see PMID:24107613). Take care to correctly annotate based on the reaction products, rather than name.	synonym: "(S)-ureidoglycolate urea-lyase (glyoxylate-forming)" RELATED [EC:4.3.2.3]
